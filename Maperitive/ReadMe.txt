Maperitive Readme
-----------------

Maperitive is a desktop aplication for interactive mapping using OpenStreetMap data and other sources.

NOTE: While it will probably not burn your computer or kill your pets, Maperitive is highly undocumented 
and almost certainly full of bugs. Also, it's not very user-friendly.
Keep in mind that a lot of things will probably change (and hopefully improve) in the near future.

You can submit bugs, annoyances, suggestions and praises via mail to support@maperitive.net
There is also an automatic bug reporting function in Maperitive.

And thanks for being brave and trying it out!
