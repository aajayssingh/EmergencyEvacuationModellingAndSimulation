	Introduction
</h2>
<p>Maperitive draws maps in several stages. Each new stage draws <i>on top</i> of previous stages. The painting stages are (in order):</p><ol>
	<li><strong>MapBackground</strong>: if the map does not contain sea, this stage is used to draw the land background. If the map contains sea, this stage is used to draw the sea polygons.</li>
	<li><strong>Landmass</strong>: if the map contains sea, this stage is used to draw the land (on top of sea polygons).</li>
	<li><strong>BitmapBackground</strong>: in this stage raster images and Web map tiles are drawn (but only if they are configured to be drawn in the background).</li>
	<li><strong>LandUse</strong>: this stage is used to draw all fill <i>(TODO)</i> symbols.</li>
	<li><strong>BitmapForeground</strong>: in this stage raster images are drawn (but only if they are configured to be drawn in the foreground).</li>
	<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: in this stage all contour <i>(TODO)</i> and line <i>(TODO)</i> symbols are drawn.</li>
	<li><strong>Symbols</strong>: in this stage all <a href="Symbols/icon.html">icon</a> and <a href="Symbols/shape.html">shape</a> symbols are drawn.</li>
	<li><strong>Labels</strong>: this stage is used to draw all <a href="Symbols/text.html">text</a> symbols.</li>
	<li><strong>BitmapOverlay</strong>: in this stage Web map tiles are drawn (but only if they are configured to be drawn in the foreground).</li>
	<li><strong>MapLegend</strong>: this stage is used to draw map decoration elements, like the map grid and the map scale.</li>

</ol>

	Techniques
</h2>
<p>You can use MapMinPaintingStage <i>(TODO)</i>, MapMaxPaintingStage <i>(TODO)</i> and MapHiddenPaintingStages <i>(TODO)</i> settings to control which stages will be painted. This can be useful if, for example, you want to render a map without any text labels - you can use the existing rendering rules without any modifications.</p><p><div class="seealso">
