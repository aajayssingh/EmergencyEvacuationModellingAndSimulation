Download the latest version of the Maperitive zip file from http://maperitive.net/download/ and unzip it into a directory of your choosing. Maperitive also requires a couple of dependencies. These can be installed by opening a Terminal window and running:

sudo apt-get install libmono-winforms2.0-cil mono-devel
Once these have downloaded and installed, navigate to the directory in which you unzipped Maperitive, mark the Maperitive.sh file as executable and run it. This can be done by right-clicking the file and changing the properties to "Allow executing file as program", alternatively run the following lines in Terminal:

chmod +x ./Maperitive.sh
./Maperitive.sh
